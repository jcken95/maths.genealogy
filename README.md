Search for mathematicians on the [Mathematics Genealogy Project](https://mathgenealogy.org/) and pull full ancestor and/or descendent academic genealogical data.
The latter functionality is possible thanks to the WebSocket server run by [@davidalber](https://github.com/davidalber), which we access directly [with kind permission](https://github.com/davidalber/geneagrapher/issues/38).
The package also provides functionality to export these genealogical datasets to different plotting environments.

## Installation

Once the package reaches beta quality, it will be available to install from R-universe, and once it is of release quality will be submitted to CRAN.

In the mean time, you can install the development version direct from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pak("louisaslett/maths.genealogy")
```

## Example

The first task is to identify the ID of the mathematician(s) you would like to build the genealogical data for.
For the author of this package, that would be:

``` r
library("maths.genealogy")

search_id("Aslett", "Louis")
```

TODO: add further examples as extra functions built
